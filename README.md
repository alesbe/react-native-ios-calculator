React Native project inspired by the iOS Calculator App desing, with slight variations.

## 🛠️ Tools used for the project

- [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)

## 💻 Installation
For now, only the app source code will be uploaded.

## ⚙️ Usage and characteristics
The usage is almost the same as the iOS one, hoever, these are some of the validations that the calculator does:
- Multiple 0 before a decimal separator validation
- Multiple commas validation
- Input limited to 10 digits (for now), for design reasons
- Changed % button with a del button

## 📝 Notes
- San Francisco font (iOS font), was disabled from `./theme/appTheme.tsx` because is not imported in the github repo, however, is the default one for iOS devices. For Android is [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)
